## ðŸ§ª Lab Challenge: Linux Fundamentals â€“ Hack The Box Academy

**Problem Statement:**  
Learn how to interact with and navigate Linux systems from the command line, including user and file management, services, and package handling.

**Approach:**  
- Studied Linux history, architecture, and distributions  
- Practiced shell interactions and terminal emulators  
- Explored prompts, system information, and user configurations  
- Navigated the file system using commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`  
- Managed users and groups, set permissions  
- Learned about redirection, file descriptors, and file searching (`find`, `locate`)  
- Understood basic package management and services handling  

**Tools Used:**  
- Linux Terminal (Bash, Zsh)  
- `man`, `uname`, `vim`, `nano`, `find`, `locate`  
- Package managers (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`)  
- System tools (`ps`, `top`, `systemctl`)


**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- **Linux is structured but powerful**: Mastering the command line unlocks almost everything in Linux.  
- **Redirection and file descriptors** are powerful tools to automate tasks and analyze data flow.  
- **Package managers simplify software handling**: but knowing what happens under the hood is vital for secure and efficient system administration.  
- **User permissions and groups are central** to security and must be configured properly to avoid privilege misuse.
