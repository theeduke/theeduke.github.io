## ðŸ§ª Lab Challenge: Windows Fundamentals â€“ Hack The Box Academy

**Problem Statement:**  
Understand how to interact with, secure, and manage Windows operating systems, services, and file systems using Windows-native tools.

**Approach:**  
- Explored remote access technologies with focus on RDP  
- Learned about Windows file systems: FAT32, NTFS, exFAT  
- Compared NTFS and Share Permissions and their impact on security  
- Managed Windows services and processes via GUI and command-line tools  
- Practiced system interaction using PowerShell and Windows CLI  
- Studied Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and its administrative capabilities  
- Touched on Windows security basics: user accounts, group policies, and service hardening

**Tools Used:**  
- Remote Desktop (RDP)  
- PowerShell, Command Prompt  
- MMC, Task Manager  
- Windows Security Tools & WMI queries


**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- **Remote access must be secured**: Tools like RDP offer power but also open doors for attackers.  
- **Permissions hierarchy is complex but critical**: Misunderstanding NTFS and Share Permissions can expose sensitive files.  
- **WMI and PowerShell are essential tools** for automation, monitoring, and incident response in Windows environments.  
- **Windows isn't just a GUI**: The command line is powerful and necessary for deep system interactions.
