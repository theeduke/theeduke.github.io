About Me
I'm Ian Oscar, a Junior Software Engineer based in Bungoma, Kenya. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, I specialize in backend development, RESTful APIs, and Python-based frameworks like Django and Flask. My experience includes internships at Candlesticks Investments Ltd and Legal Tech Kenya, where I honed my skills in API development, testing, and technical documentation.
I’m passionate about solving complex problems, collaborating in teams, and continuously learning new technologies. My technical expertise includes Python, JavaScript, C, Linux/Unix systems, and database management. I’m also proficient in creating engaging presentations and communicating technical concepts to diverse audiences.
